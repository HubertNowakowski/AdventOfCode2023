Schematic - static for all numbers

is a number also a symbol?

1. Find all numbers in schematic

Number attributes:
- number value
- location in schematic:
  * line number
  * start index (in the line)
  * end index (in the line)
- is part number?

for number in numbers_list:
    check if number is part number:
        is there a symbol before number.start?
        is there a symbol after number.end?
        is there a symbol in line above number, in range(start-1, end+1)?
        is there a symbol in line below number, in range(start-1, end+1)?
    set number.is_part_num

sum all numbers that are part_num
